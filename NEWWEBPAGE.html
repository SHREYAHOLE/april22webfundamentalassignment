    <h1>WEB TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
      JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion
      of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
      Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of
      the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
      presentational HTML since 1997.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
      presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects
      such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
      rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for
      example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content,
      split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
      features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS
      mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and
      how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
    </p>
    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted,
      object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as
      the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser
      environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting
      language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and
      functional programming styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design
      / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event.
      JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language,
      widely used for controlling web page behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented
      language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching
      methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed
      to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++
      and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a
      blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction,
      variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via
      eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery
      (JavaScript programs can decompile function bodies back into their source
      text).
